Description: This package finds the best model according to their AIC or BIC. For example, consider a dataset with 5 independent variables. There are a total of 31 possible model combinations possible and each will give a separate AIC. Instead of manually creating candidate models and then comparing their AIC/BIC, this package automatically computes the best model (the one with the lowest AIC and BIC score) according to all AIC/BIC values for all 31 combinations and returns the AIC/BIC of the selected model, the coefficients and the adjusted R2.
